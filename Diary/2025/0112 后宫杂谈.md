### mayadere

A "mayadere" is a character archetype in anime and manga that refers to someone who starts off as a hostile or antagonistic figure but gradually warms up to the protagonist or others, sometimes developing romantic feelings in the process. These characters are often complex, with motivations or backstories that justify their initial antagonism. The "maya" part of the term implies their dangerous nature, while "dere" refers to their softer, more affectionate side that emerges over time.

By saying, *"I hope she becomes a mayadere,"* you're expressing a desire for Orphelia Landlufen to follow this character development arc—starting as a challenging or adversarial figure but eventually revealing a more compassionate or vulnerable side. This could add emotional depth to her story and make her interactions more compelling.
