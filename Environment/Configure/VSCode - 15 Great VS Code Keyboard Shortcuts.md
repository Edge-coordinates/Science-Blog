Multiple Cursors allow you to make edits in multiple lines simultaneously. It is very useful on occasions when you to similar changes across lines.

Delete the Line allows you to delete a whole line at once instead of deleting it letter by letter or word by word. To delete a line in VS Code, you have to go to the line you wish to delete and type **[Ctrl + Shift + K]**.

VS Code not only allows you to write in Markdown but also allows you to preview the file. To do so, open the Markdown preview window by typing **[Ctrl + Shift + V]**.

‍

7. Toggle Sidebar
-----------------

The VS Code sidebar that is located on the left-hand side is one of the most important part of the UI. It's home to lots of features like File structure, Search, Extension Marketplace and others.

However, it can also be a distraction while coding and it'll also take part of your coding screen. In such cases, you can easily toggle the sidebar by pressing **Ctrl + B**.

8. Rename Component
-------------------

If your project is big and component is matured, changing the name of the component can be really hard now. Because you have to also update the name at places where it is referred.

Rename Component is a really powerful feature of VS Code that helps you here. Just move your cursor to where you have declared your component and type **F2**.

Now VS Code will change the component name and also update its subsequent references to reflect the updated name.

**9. Select** Current **Line**
------------------------------

Often times, you need to select and copy a whole line to paste it somewhere in the project either in the current file or another file. Creating a copy of the current line just one line above or below is easier, you have to just type **Shift + Alt + Up/Down**.

But what about when the location you want to paste the current line at is not an immediate neighbour? In such case, type **Ctrl + L** to select the line and copy paste it wherever you want.

10. Switch Tabs
---------------

Any serious project is incomplete without multiple file tabs opened in VS Code. Switching these tabs manually by clicking on them can be tiring and also result in productivity loss often times.

Instead, use **Ctrl + Pg Up** and **Ctrl + Pg Down** for quicker and effective switching of the tabs.

11. Search File
---------------

When working on a large project, jumping from one file to another is quite common and you don't want to scan through long list of directories and files to find the file you are looking for.

VS Code has a file search option to solve this problem. Type **Ctrl + P** and type the name of the file you are searching for.

12. Toggle Terminal
-------------------

When you are working on a development project, many times you have multiple active terminals, one for running the dev server. Another for installing dependencies and so on.

However, Terminal takes up space on the screen and you don’t want it to appear on the screen when you are coding. In this situation, you can toggle the terminal by typing **Ctrl + `**(backtick).

13. Format Document
-------------------

Format Document is a feature that enables you to automatically adjust the indentation and formatting of your code according to the preconfigured rules within the editor. It helps in improving the readability and maintainability of the code.

Type **Ctrl + Shift + F** to format the code of your current file.

14. Split Editor
----------------

Split Editor is a special feature of VS Code that allows you to view multiple files on one screen. It's really useful when you are comparing two different files or when you want to refer a file while making changes to another file.

Press **Ctrl + \** to split the current file into another editor.

15. Select the current word
---------------------------

VS Code also allows you to copy the current word your cursor is located at. To do so, press **Ctrl + D**. This shortcut is really useful when you want to copy paste a certain word from the code.
