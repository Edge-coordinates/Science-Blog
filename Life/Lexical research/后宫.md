# Polygamist

An individual who practices or advocates for polygamy is commonly referred to as a "polygamist."  This term applies to anyone who engages in or supports the practice of having multiple spouses simultaneously. In specific contexts, such as within certain religious groups, these individuals may also be called "Mormon fundamentalists," particularly when referring to those who uphold early Mormon doctrines that include plural marriage.  However, "polygamist" remains the most widely recognized and used term for someone who advocates for or practices polygamy.
