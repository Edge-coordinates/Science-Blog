_In this issue, we’re transitioning from AI as an answer-giver to a thinking partner. Learn how to use prompts that teach metacognition, discover what the latest research says about AI and critical thinking, and explore a syllabus-building bot._

#### This is the most powerful prompt you’re (probably) not using.

Most of us jump straight to giving AI instructions. What if you flipped the script and asked AI to ask _you_ questions first?

This one simple shift transforms AI from a task-taker into a thinking partner. Instead of guessing what you need, the model becomes your expert interviewer, uncovering exactly what will make the output useful.

**The Formula:**

```
Ask me questions one at a time until you have enough information to [YOUR GOAL].
```

This technique turns vague requests into precise, personalized results. Let’s see it in action:

**For building a meeting agenda:**

```
Ask me questions one at a time until you have enough information to help me build a comprehensive meeting agenda for [MEETING TYPE/COMMITTEE]. Consider items such as [KEY TOPICS, DECISION POINTS, TIME CONSTRAINTS] that help [ATTENDEES] accomplish [MEETING OBJECTIVES] efficiently.
```

**For writing an FAQ document:**

```
Ask me questions one at a time until you have enough information to help me build an FAQ for [DEPARTMENT]. Consider items such as [TOPICS] that help [AUDIENCE] achieve [GOAL].
```

**For supporting a student:**

```
Ask me questions one at a time until you have enough information to help me design accommodations and support strategies for a struggling student in my class.
```

**Why it works:** This _one-question-at-a-time_ approach mirrors how great consultants and great teachers think. They don’t assume what you need; they discover it through thoughtful inquiry.

Let AI slow down, ask better questions, and help you uncover what you _actually_ need.

_Pro Tip: This is also a beautiful way to model **metacognition** for students. They see that asking questions is part of smart work, not a sign of uncertainty._


BoodleBox gives you access to all the major LLMs (large language models). Each week, we explore an AI model and help you think strategically about how to use it to achieve your AI goals.

_The Problem Solver_

ChatGPT, from OpenAI, excels at creativity, structure, and problem-solving. It’s ideal for brainstorming ideas, formatting content, coding support, or organizing complex projects. Think of it as your strategic partner for turning big ideas into action.

#### Emerging studies show that AI isn’t just about generating answers.

It can also help learners reflect on their thinking and regulate their learning.

A [2025 systematic review](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2025.1672901/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com) found that AI-powered learning analytics supported metacognitive and socio-emotional development in students. [Another study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-01676-x?utm_source=chatgpt.com) found a positive link between the use of generative-AI tools, shared metacognition, and academic achievement among preservice teachers.

At the same time, [some research suggests](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/1/6?utm_source=chatgpt.com) that AI use can diminish critical thinking through overreliance or cognitive offloading. The key is _how_ AI is used. As with any tool, intentional design and reflection make the difference between growth and stagnation.

How you use AI determines whether you strengthen or lose your critical thinking muscle.

**What this means for faculty:** Use AI not just to generate output, but to ask _why_, _what if_, and _how_ you’re thinking. Model that reflection for students and design workflows that foreground _thinking before answering._

#### Do you ask good questions?

Imagine AI as a brilliant but literal translator of your thoughts. The magic isn’t in the tool, but in how you communicate with it. Your prompt is like a key, and the way you craft that key determines whether you’ll unlock a treasure or just rattle an empty lock.

Consider two travelers asking for directions:

*   _Traveler A says,_ “Help me get somewhere.”
    
*   _Traveler B says,_ “I’m trying to reach a historic lighthouse on the rocky coast. I have a rental car and limited time before sunset, so I want to capture some photographs. What’s the most scenic route that ensures I’ll arrive safely?”
    

Who do you think gets the better directions?

BoodleBox’s **[PromptBot](https://box.boodle.ai/a/promptbot)** helps you hone your requests. Select the prompt bot and ask it to help you write a strong request. It will also help you select the right AI model for your question.

To turn the vague into the valuable, try these techniques:

*   **Be Specific:** Context is your secret weapon.
    
*   **Provide Details:** The more you share, the more precise the response.
    
*   **Give Clear Parameters:** Guide the AI like you’d guide a talented but literal assistant.

#### Set the tone for AI use and evaluate your syllabus.

The first week of class sets the tone for how AI will be used in your course. When you’re open about AI’s limits and willing to wrestle with the unknown alongside your students, you signal that AI is a tool for learning, not a shortcut. That transparency reduces the temptation to misuse it and builds trust from the start.

To support these conversations, explore these three helpful resources:

*   **Leon Furze’s** _**[AI Assessment Scale](https://leonfurze.com/2024/08/28/updating-the-ai-assessment-scale/):**_ A framework for deciding when and how AI use is appropriate.
    
*   **Dr. Brian Doak’s** _**[How to Use AI as a College Student](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR9X9kRdgbk):**_ A concise guide on citing and integrating AI responsibly.
    
*   **Oregon State University’s** _**[Bloom’s Taxonomy Revisited](https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/faculty/artificial-intelligence-tools/blooms-taxonomy-revisited/):**_ For designing learning objectives and assessments in an AI-aware classroom.
    

_Pro Tip: Setting expectations early builds a culture of integrity and curiosity._

Try the **[EduBot Course Syllabus](https://box.boodle.ai/a/course-syllabus)** bot. It helps you create comprehensive, AI-aware syllabi that maintain academic integrity while embracing innovation.

Simply tell the bot your course name, level, and learning objectives, and it will guide you through building a syllabus that integrates AI thoughtfully.

_Pro Tip: Upload your university’s syllabus template for a more detailed and customized result._
